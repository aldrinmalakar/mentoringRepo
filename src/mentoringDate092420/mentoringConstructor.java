    Constructors are used to initialize the state of an object whereas a Method is used to expose the behaviour of an object.
The Constructor cannot have return type whereas the Method may or may not have a return type.
The Constructor name must be same as the class name whereas the Method name may or may not be same as the class name.
The Constructor is invoked implicitly whereas the Method invoked explicitly.
The Constructor is implicitly provided by the Java compiler if you donâ€™t specify any Constructor in the java class, but the Method is never provided by the java compiler.
